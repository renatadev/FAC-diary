# 📖 FAC18 Diary 📖

### What is FAC?
Founders and Coders is a non-profit organisation that focuses on developing and running tuition-free, peer-led training programmes in web development, guided by their core values of cooperation, inclusion and social impact.

They run an intensive 16-week full-stack Javascript bootcamp three times a year and I was lucky enough to be selected to be part of the FAC18 cohort running in their London campus from October - March 2020.

As part of the application process I coded:

✅  A [portfolio website](https://renatadev.github.io/FAC/)

✅  A [JavaScript calculator](https://renatadev.github.io/JS-Calculator/) (part of pre-course)

For the first half of the course, every week we:

* Completed workshops in a new topic every hour for the first three days of the week.
* Participated in research afternoons surrounding a number of new topics.
* Completed a group project consolidating all of the learning outcomes
* Delivered presentations
* Reviewed another group's code

For the second half, we worked on two extended projects. One was a cohort-selected student project, and the other was a client-driven **Tech for Better project** to develop a social impact app.

Here is a log of my experiences week by week:

# Week 8 - Express ⚡️
### Learning outcomes: 
Express server, express middleware, handlebars, MVC pattern

### Project: Build a server-rendered full-stack app

> Build an app using the Express framework. Use a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve your data. Use the retrieved data to populate a Handlebars template for server-side rendering to be displayed on the front-end.

# Week 5 - Node.js 2/2 🚀
### Learning outcomes: 
API calls from the back-end using the Node http module, testing (supertest, tap-spec, codecov & Travis CI), node commands 

### Project: API calls from the back-end and testing the server

> Create a web app that includes some form of user input and provides users with content from an API that is regularly updated - e.g. the same user input submitted at different times could result in different content being retrieved.
